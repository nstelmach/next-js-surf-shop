\n
Because SURF is a brand created out of love. For an active lifestyle, for mountains, water, wind and space.
For people who, like us, love traveling, adventure and living life to the fullest.
\n
All clothes are sewn from the highest quality natural materials. Cotton is made from scratch in Poland, manufactured to 
our special order. It is additionally subjected to special refinement and softening processes, which makes it so pleasant 
to the touch and use.
\n
Our cotton has all the highest Oeko-Tex Standard 100 and GOTS certificates, which is a guarantee of the highest possible 
quality and safety. Cotton with such certificates meets the most rigorous production, ecological and environmental 
criteria. This is very important, because it wraps our skin.
\n
All elements from cotton to packaging are made 100% in Polish workshops, they are created by people who put their whole 
♥ into them! We operate locally!
\n
Nature is an inspiration, and our mission is to create sustainable, human- and environmentally friendly fashion that 
will wrap for many years. We focus on quality, not quantity
\n
Why do our sweatshirts disappear so quickly? We sew small quantities, release single drops and personally supervise 
the entire process, so that every, the smallest detail is refined. We do not accumulate surplus stock.
\n
The long production process is caused by the fact that each element is made from scratch. From choosing the yarn, 
through creating the knitwear, choosing the colour, making tests, creating embroidery, adding refinement to the 
knitwear, and finally to creating all kinds of accessories such as woven labels.
\n
Our clothes are exceptionally warm, soft and enveloping. The sporty style is broken by refined and distinctive 
embroidery and graphics that inspire, take you to the world of travel and nature. They bring to mind the most 
beautiful moments. They are associated with slow life, the smell of the sea, mountain air, pine forest, wood 
crackling in the fireplace in a cottage, somewhere at the end of the world. Relaxation and comfort are also the main 
theme. This is how we want to live!
\n
Their minimalist form makes them perfect both for travel and in urban spaces, in a more casual climate. These are 
universal things with a super twist that you want to wear regardless of where you are and how old you are!
\n
SURF is also total comfort. An active lifestyle is very close to us, so when designing drops we focus on 100% comfort! 
We create clothes that we love to wear ourselves.
\n
Snowboarding, surfing, road trip? Or maybe tea on the beach on a windy day, or a meeting in the city? SURF clothes 
will provide you with mega comfort and super style everywhere.
